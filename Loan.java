//Loanâ€”A public abstract class that implements the LoanConstants interface. A Loan
//includes a loan number, customer last name, amount of loan, interest rate, and term. The
//constructor requires data for each of the fields except interest rate. Do not allow loan
//amounts greater than R100, 000. Force any loan term that is not one of the three defined
//in the LoanConstants class to a short- term, 1-year loan. Create a toString() method that
//displays all the loan data. Loan.java
